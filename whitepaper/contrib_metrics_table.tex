                 Metric Name &                                                                       Description \\
\hline\hline
 AngularSpreadMetric &  Compute the angular spread statistic which measures uniformity of a distribution \\
  &  angles accounting for 2pi periodicity. \\
 CampaignLengthMetric &  The campaign length, in seasons. \\
 GRBTransientMetric &  Detections for on-axis GRB afterglows decaying as \\
 GalaxyCountsMetric &  Estimate the number of galaxies expected at a particular coadded depth. \\
 GalaxyCountsMetric\_extended &  Estimate galaxy counts per HEALpix pixel. Accomodates for dust extinction, \\
  &  magnitude cuts, \\
 MeanNightSeparationMetric &  The mean separation between nights within a season, and then the mean over the \\
  &  campaign. \\
 NumObsMetric &  Calculate the number of observations per data slice. \\
 PeriodDeviationMetric &  Measure the percentage deviation of recovered periods for pure sine wave \\
  &  variability (in magnitude). \\
 PeriodicMetric &  From a set of observation times, uses code provided by Robert Siverd (LCOGT) to \\
  &  calculate the spectral window function. \\
 PeriodicStarMetric &  At each slicePoint, run a Monte Carlo simulation to see how well a periodic \\
  &  source can be fit. \\
 RelRmsMetric &  Relative scatter metric (RMS over median). \\
 SEDSNMetric &  Computes the S/Ns for a given SED. \\
 SNMetric &  Calculate the signal to noise metric in a given filter for an object of a given \\
  &  magnitude. \\
 SeasonLengthMetric &  The mean season length, in months. \\
 StarCountMassMetric &  Find the number of stars in a given field in the mass range fainter than \\
  &  magnitude 16 and bright enough to have noise less than 0.03 in a given band. M1 \\
  &  and M2 are the upper and lower limits of the mass range. ``band" is the band to \\
  &  be observed. \\
 StarCountMetric &  Find the number of stars in a given field between D1 and D2 in parsecs. \\
 TdcMetric &  Combine campaign length, season length, and mean night speartion into a single \\
  &  metric. \\
 ThreshSEDSNMetric &  Computes the metric whether the S/N is bigger than the threshold in all the \\
  &  bands for a given SED \\
 TransientAsciiMetric &  Based on the transientMetric, but uses an ascii input file and provides option \\
  &  to write out lightcurve. \\
 TripletBandMetric &  Find the number of ``triplets" of three images taken in the same band, based on \\
  &  user-selected minimum and maximum intervals (in hours), \\
 TripletMetric &  Find the number of ``triplets" of three images taken in any band, based on user- \\
  &  selected minimum and maximum intervals (in hours), \\
