% This individual section will need to describe the particular
% discoveries and measurements that are being targeted in this section's
% science case. It will be helpful to think of a ``science case" as a
% ``science project" that the authors {\it actually plan to do}. Then,
% the sections can follow the tried and tested format of an observing
% proposal: a brief description of the investigation, with references,
% followed by a technical feasibility piece. This latter part will need
% to be quantified using the MAF framework, via a set of metrics that
% need to be computed for any given observing strategy to quantify its
% impact on the described science case. Ideally, these metrics would be
% combined in a well-motivated figure of merit. The section can conclude
% with a discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how
% these could be mitigated.

Interstellar dust is a significant constituent of the Galaxy. Its
composition and associated extinction properties tell us about the
material and environments in which stars and their planets are formed.
Dust also presents an obstacle for a wide-range of astronomical
observations, causing light from stars in the plane of the Milky Way
to be severely dimmed and causing the apparent colors of objects
observed in any direction to be shifted from their intrinsic
values. These color shifts are dependent upon the dust column density
along the line of sight and the radiative transport properties of the
dust grains.

To first order, i.e. neglecting the effects of heterochromatic
extinction, the absorption of light in each band due to dust is
dependent upon the column density, related to $E(B-V)$, and the nature
of the dust grains, as parameterized by the ratio of general to
selection extinction in the Johnson $B$ and $V$ bands, defined as $R_V
= A_V /E(B âˆ’ V)$.  In the low-density diffuse ISM, $R_V$ has a value
$\sim 3.1$, while in dense molecular clouds $R_V$ can be higher with
values $4 < R_V < 6$.

%% WIC 2016-04-26 - both the above paras are already in the Science
%% Book.

In general, however, the use of broad band photometry requires
attention to the intrinsic SEDs of the background stars in order to
correct for heterochromatic variations in the effective reddening
law. As discussed in the LSST Science Book, possession of an accurate
dust map is important to many astrophysical studies. The two most
significant all-sky maps generated in the past two decades are the
SFD98 maps based on IRAS observations, and the recent thermal dust
maps derived from Planck submillimeter data. The angular resolutions
of both maps are similar - between 4 to 6 arcminutes.

Both of the aforementioned maps are strictly two-dimensional and
conntain no information about the distribution of dust along the line
of sight. A third dimension can be obtained by analysis of accurate
stellar photometry which constrain both the reddening $E(B-V)$ and
$R_V$ towards individual stars. This approach requires determination
of the intrinsic stellar colors and the photometric parallax of each
star in the presence of an unknown amount and law of extinction.
Recent work on 3-D maps include the Bayesian analysis method based on
Pan-STARRS 1 data (Green et al. 2015, ApJ, 810, 25) and an alternative
technique using SDSS photometry of M dwarfs (McGehee et al. 2016, in
preparation).

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

The use of stellar samples to create three-dimensional extinction maps has an established history
beginning with the work of Neckel \& Klare (1980); however these, including studies based on SDSS and
PS1 photometry, are typically limited to heliocentric distances of $\sim$4 kpc. In the full co-added survey,
LSST will be able to map dust structures out to distances exceeding 40 kpc, thus revealing a
detailed picture of this component of the Milky Way Galaxy.

The Pan-STARRS1 survey (PS1) has
produced a three-dimensional dust map of the region of the sky covered
in their 3$\pi$ survey (which excludes a large part of the Galactic
Plane toward the south). Such maps are necessary to accurately measure
the intrinsic luminosities and colors of both Galactic and
extragalactic sources. 
Green et al. (2015) estimated $R_V$ along sightlines having higher 
reddening values as well as reddening values.
The PS1 map saturates at
extinctions $E(B-V) > 1.5$ as their tracer stars fall out of the
survey catalogs fainter than $g\sim 22$, meaning that this
high-fidelity map does not extend uniformly to within a few degrees of
the midplane. In addition, it only extends to a distance of about 4.5
kpc. Deep LSST data will allow this map to be extended to much higher
extinctions and larger distances. Owing to the high extinction and the
use of blue filters, this project is less affected by crowding than
other projects requiring photometry in the Plane. 

In comparison, the SDSS survey makes use of M dwarf locus in
$(g-r,r-i)$ being nearly perpendicular to the reddening vector in that
color-color space. This allows mapping of a reddening-invariant index
to the intrinsic stellar $g-i$ color and subsequent deterimation of
the light-of-sight reddening. This approach assumes a set extinction
law, i.e $R_V = 3.1$, in order compute the reddening-invariant index
from the observed $g-r$ and $r-i$ colors. Given the relative faintness
of M dwarfs, this technique is distance limited to $\sim$1 kpc when
based on SDSS data.

The LSST will be in a unique position to measure the changes in the observed reddening vector
due to $R_V$ variations due to its superb photometric accuracy. 
Both of the dust survey techniques mentioned here can be used on LSST data, and perhaps other 
methods will be developed before the start of survey operations. T

\subsection{Metrics}

\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

Production of a 3-D map of the dust component of the ISM based on LSST photometry will tell us 
how much dust is present, what type it is, and where it is along the line of sight. 
The latter concern brings in issues of how to determine stellar photometric parallaxes ($\mu = m-M$) under
an unknown reddening.

The dust maps that are created will consist of the median and variance of $E(B-V)$ and $R_V$ expressed as functions of 
$\mu$ under a suitable binning scheme. We can create simple Figure of Merit maps that lose the 
$\mu$ dependency by computing the mean and variance of the measured variances in $E(B-V)$ and $R_V$ 
over the $\mu$ bins.

With the possible exception of sightlines towards star formation
regions, the spacing in time of the visits doesn't matter for dust
studies. In the case of active star formation regions it is possible
that changes in the ISM could be apparent over the lifetime of the
survey.  Pushing to fainter magnitudes (which means both better seeing
and longer exposures) matters, both because we want more stars, and in
particular, we want more stars behind the dust.


{\bf Metric 1: Uncertainty and bias in $E(B-V)$~estimates as a
  function of location on-sky.} Dependencies:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Stellar population throughout the survey (e.g. Knut / Peter developments; TRILEGAL?);
    \item Dust map throughout the survey region;
    \item Scale photometric error predictions for each band from program requirements per exposure;
      \item Produce formal estimate on the error in extinction and reddening as a function of position on-sky within the survey.
\end{itemize}
